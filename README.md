The most recent paper is on the top level, ssome, but not all drafts are included in backref folder.

Turing was one of the greatest minds of all time. I am not working to surpass his contributions, only to rectify an honest, very human omission in his work that was a result of the zeitgeist of his time. Gödel's incompleteness was his inspiration for his work on the Entscheidungsproblem, and mathematicians had a surge of breakthroughs by imposing arbitrary limitations on their thinking. However, I believe a blind spot was created, which has been perpetuated to this day. The only way science has any legitimacy at all is if we have the ability to approach our legends and heroes as mere men of mortality like ourselves and not as the gods of which they have been portrayed. The only requirement is an open mind and years of study.

This paper has, over the last month or so, lead me to a new project which allows several advances in cryptography due to the existance of a oneway function, given that EXPSPACE-hard problems still exist which are larger than RE. The one-way pad is an example from this complexity class and holds theoretically 100% unbreakable encryption.
